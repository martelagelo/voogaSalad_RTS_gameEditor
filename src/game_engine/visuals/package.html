This package contains the elements necessary for managing the UI for the engine. It contains a class
that extends JavaFX.Scene (ScrollableBackground), which can later be passed to the Player for display.
The VisualManager contains all of the elements for managing the Scene and it's interactions. It also contains
a class for automatically generating the terrain for the map, the TerrainGrid.

This package also contains Observable handlers for when IO occurs. When the user clicks on the screen, the 
ClickManager notifies everyone observing it. This translates the click's location from the location on the
screen to the location on the map. In this way, the actions occurring on the map are removed from where events
actually occurred on the screen, so that all interaction can work appropriately.

The IO handled is clicks in the ClickManager, keyboard input in the KeyboardManager, and clicking and dragging in
the SelectionBox.

This package also contains the Animation hierarchy. Animations for DisplayableGameElements are stored in AnimationSequences,
where each AnimationSequence corresponds to a fixed number of frames from one of the sprite sheets stored in the resources.
An AnimationPlayer is created for each DisplayableGameElement, which contains the AnimationSequences and manages playing the 
different animations.

The Animations use the Null pattern in order to take care of having an undefined AnimationSequence.
