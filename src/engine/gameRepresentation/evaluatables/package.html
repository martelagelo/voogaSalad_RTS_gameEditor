The list of conditions that can be triggered for a GameElement. The conditions
are composed of two main types; Evaluators operate on primitive values, such
as numbers and strings, while Operators operate on evaluators and other operators.
This distinction exists to separate what inputs each condition component takes in;
Operators take in booleans, and Evaluators may take in numbers or strings.

Evaluators may also have parameters associated with them, for instance to query
if the hp of an enemy is below 10.

Operators are examples of a composite strategy pattern; several Evaluators are held
by a single Operator, and both individual Evaluators and the Operator implement the
Evaluatable interface. Each Evaluator is a strategy which implements
Evaluatable.evaluate() differently.

This package also contains a front-end ConditionParser to consume a condition and
output the result of evaluating that condition.
