This package contains the main logic for the game engine. The engine receives game states from the model and
is responsible for building game elements from these game states and attaching non-serializable graphical 
representations to these elements. At the model's essence is the @link {game_engine.stateManaging.GameLoop.java} 
class. This class goes through all the elements of the game and calls their update methods for various inputs.
All functionality of the interaction between game elements is handled via the @link {game_engine.conditions.Evaluatable}
class and the @link {game_engine.conditions.actions.Action.java} classes. 
</br>
The engine relies on receiving Game state through an observable relationship with the model and then builds elements
specified in the game state through a set of factories. All communication between the engine and the view is done through this
relationship with the model using the Game state.
</br>
In addition to changing and updating the states of internal game elements, the engine is also responsible for generating the 
actual game's view as it would be seen by a player. This design choice was made to reduce the engine's external API whilst at
the same time allowing the engine to have complete control over the contents of its display.
