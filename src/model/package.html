The main state representation classes for the game; MainModel is the main
containing class for model state elements. It is also responsible for talking
with the save-load utility to save the state of the game.

This package consists of factories to deserialize instances of stored game element
states from disk, and a MainModel class which allows other game components to query
and update the state of the MainModel.
