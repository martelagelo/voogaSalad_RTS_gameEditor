These computers allow for easy calculations of relationships between objects. They are used by the game loop to identify things like object collisions and view box intersections. At their most fundamental level, computers take in a list of elements and an element to compare said elements to, finds the elements that match this criteria, and notifies the main element of the other elements that meet the criteria.
